Ah, the autumn. A season perfect for pumpkin spice, apple cider, and participating in Digital Ocean's annual month-long celebration of open source!

Yesterday, I ~~went to~~ ~~attended~~ (there really aren't that many ways to say, "I was there, but I wasn't *there*-there," huh?) joined an online meetup centered on Hacktober. Several repo maintainers presented their work. They were all interesting, but my favorite was the [Pursued Py Bear][Pursued Py Bear] repository. It's basically a game development engine written in python. So far, I've fixed a couple of the listed issues in the repo.

I also started my own Hacktober repo. It's something that I've been wanting to do for a while. I'm essentially trying to create a library of photo manipulation methods. I've worked on stuff in that wheelhouse a little bit before and enjoyed it, and working on it now for Hacktober gives me a chance to practice some computer vision programming. 

Free T-shirt, here I come!
