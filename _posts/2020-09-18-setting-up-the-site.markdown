I created the initial commit for this site a while back and then became sidetracked with other projects, but I decided that it's finally time to dust off the old code files and finish creating a portfolio of my work.

I've been thinking about how I want to format the site. What I have so far is to split up the posts into two groups: general progress, like this post, and progress on specific projects. The general progress posts will go on the front page to give an overview of what I've been working on recently. I'll add a dropdown to the menu to show all the projects I've worked on, then link each dropdown option to its own page with posts specific to that project. While setting up this site is technically a project I'm working on, it seems a little [meta][meta] to have a project page about the site on the site itself, so I'll keep progress posts for this on the main page.

All of that brings us to...

# The point
The point of this site is to keep a record of the projects I've worked on and what I've learned in the process of accomplishing them. It's helpful to have something to point to when somebody asks what I've been working on. It can also be helpful when I run into a problem to look back on what steps have already been taken. It's easy to lose sight of what I'm trying to do in the process of doing it, but being able to look at how I got to the problem in the first place can remind me.
